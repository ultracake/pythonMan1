Step - by - step instructions


1. Get all repositories clone urls from the organization 'python-elective' and save them in a list, tuple, set or dictionary. For this you should make use of the urllib module, and you can get all info about the repositories at this api.
(Treat and read the json data as a text file. imagine something like a repository_info.txt. Then use the string searching and manipulations teqniques that we have worked with so far. Dealing with json data comes later this semester.)
